# About me

* Master of Arts Candidate from McMaster University with a specialization in Arctic Geography and community engagement. I have over five yearsâ€™ experience as a student within the school of Earth, Environment, and Society at McMaster University, where I have also worked as a teaching assistant, research assistant, and McPherson Institute student partner. Currently, I am collaborating on a federally funded project with team members across Canada to investigate how well research is serving Nunavummiut (the people of Nunavut).
