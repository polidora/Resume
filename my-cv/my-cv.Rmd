# About me

* I trained in civil engineering before being adopted into geography.
* My areas of interest include spatial analysis, spatial statistics, transportation, travel behavior, cities.
* Also, too, mathematics, computer languages, science fiction, poetry, and memes.
* I have been known to look professorial on occasion.
* At this rate my only hope of being recognized is as the most promising oldest researcher in my discipline.
